# Excel-DashBoard




üîç Excel Dashboard Project: Global Tuberculosis Data Analysis (1990‚Äì2013)
 üìä Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
As part of my B.Tech coursework at Lovely Professional University, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes over two decades of global tuberculosis (TB) data sourced from the World Health Organization. The project focused on analyzing trends, regional disparities, and co-infection with HIV across 200+ countries.
‚ú® Key Features:
Cleaned and preprocessed over 5,000 records using Excel formulas and techniques
Built dynamic dashboards with pivot tables, slicers, and various chart types
Analyzed TB incidence, prevalence, mortality, and HIV-TB co-infection rates
Created visual comparisons across WHO regions and over time (1990‚Äì2013)
Implemented missing data handling strategies using interpolation, forward fill, and conditional formatting
üß† Outcomes: Provided clear, actionable insights into global TB trends to help inform public health strategies, and demonstrated proficiency in transforming raw health data into interactive analytical tools using Excel.
